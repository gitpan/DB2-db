TODO

  + Rather than creating Table types, start with something simpler. (XML?)
    Then transform the XML into Table types.  This is not something I want
    to do "on-the-fly", but something that can probably help get a database
    going faster.

  + Perhaps a Gtk GUI for managing Table types?

  + A new module: DB2::View for creating views on other tables.
