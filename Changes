Revision history for Perl extension DB2.

0.10
	* Original version: a massive rewrite from the three or four
	  previous frameworks, first time prepared for possible
          redistribution

0.11
        ! Added significant (read: non-trivial) test cases.  Found problems
          while doing so.  Reorganised some code.

0.12
        + Added SELECT_join, find_join to DB2::Table
        + Added case insensitive match for DB2::db::get_table

0.13
        ! API CHANGE
	  - Obsoleted get_row_table_relationship
          + Add add_row_table_relationship (to add more flexibility,
            and save me some significant typing)

0.14
        + Added !!!/!<tbl>! support to CONSTRAINT and FOREIGNKEY
          column attributes
        + Improved return codes from DB2::Row->save() - should be able
          to reliably use "true" as success.  Note that if nothing has
          changed, it is considered "true" that it saved okay.
        + Add default ROW setting for setup_row_table_relationship
          Defaults to C<$tablename . "R"> .
        + Added add_table as a simpler way to call
          add_row_table_relationship (especially when using the new
          default)

0.15
        + Added default row type - now you don't need to derive a type
          from DB2::Row if you have nothing to overload.  Deriving from
          DB2::Table remains since you always have to overload data_order.
        + Added add_tables as a simpler way to call add_table, only if
          using the defaults.
        + Added set_default_package for adding tables in other packages.

0.16
        + Added get_base_row_type (was base_row_type in 0.15, but not
          documented).
        * Submitted to CPAN for the first time
