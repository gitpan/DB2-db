QUICK START:

    Finish reading this README.  Install by doing:
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install
    
    At this point, the source tree is no longer needed - you can delete
    it if you wish.  Note, however, that there is a sample provided in
    the samples directory that you may want to look at before deleting.
